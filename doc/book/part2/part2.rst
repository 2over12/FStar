.. _Part2:

Dependently Typed Functional Programming
========================================

In this second part of the book, we'll dive deeper into F*, looking at
how to use dependent types to specify properties of programs, to
develop programs and proofs at a high level of abstraction, and to
balance proof automation with proof maintenance.

To explain some concepts, we'll get into some more detais of how F*'s
logic works, including concepts that we glossed over earlier, related
to equality, type conversion, proof irrelevance, termination proofs,
and universes. But, fear not, our focus will remain on programming and
using F*'s logic, rather than teaching you about its underlying
theory.
