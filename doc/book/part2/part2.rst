.. _Part2:

Representing Data, Proofs, and Computations with Inductive Types
================================================================

In this second part of the book, we'll dive deeper into F*, focusing
on *inductive definitions*, the main mechanism in F* for the user to
define new types.

  Vectors for basics
    - But vectors are too simple, we can do them with just refined lists

  Merkle trees to capture more interesting invariants of a type

  Higher-order inductive types: infinitely branching trees
    - Free monads and computation trees

  Representing proof terms: Simply-typed lambda calculus

  Representing proof terms: Accessibility predicates and termination proofs
